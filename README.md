Brief: Android application created for Code Michigan 2014

# Problem Statement
########################

As two graduating seniors, we are becoming familiar with the process of choosing a city in which to live. There are many factors that go into choosing a place to call home: cost of living, city income tax, crime rate, school district, apartment rental cost, entertainment venues, car insurance, and property taxes. The State of Michigan makes some data readily available but trying to locate it all can be stressful even with the capability of the Internet at your fingertips. In my own experience, if I’m viewing the civic data of just one city, I may end up having 10 tabs open on my Web Browser. Of course, the complexity increases as you attempt to compare two or more cities. Despite the fact that this civic data is needed by everyone, there is no “one-stop shop”. The resources already exist but the problem is that they are scattered. Well, MiMove is here to change that all while offering the convenience of fitting into your pocket.

The value in this application is the fact that the same data that was once scattered across many different resources is now in a single location. On the home screen you enter a salary and choose which type of civic data (i.e., schools, property tax, etc.) you are interested in viewing. This mobile application simplifies a once arduous task into a couple taps of the screen. This app simplifies the process and aims to simplify your life after relocation.  The more knowledge you have the more prepared you can be for the inevitable challenges that arise.  The extendable income functionality sets you up for a relocation.  You will be more preparedThis app allows the user to enter a salary <where from here?> This app allows the user to select up to three cities on a map and then compare their respective civic data. Essentially, all the data you need can be centralized with this application.

The possibilities for this application are endless. As the State of Michigan releases more data to the general public, this app can be extended and become more robust.

# Future Improvements
########################

* When app is first launched, there can be some lag in the GPS finding the location (you should notice a blinking gps signal at the top). Block UI until the GPS finds the user’s current location. This prevents a user from selecting the Map without Lat and Long.
* Graphs/Plots
* Scrollable Stats View
* color tabs (Home,Map,Stats) depending on the current activity
* Threading - the UI lags after you choose three cities
